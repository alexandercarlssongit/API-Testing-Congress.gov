## Removing Lines that Don't Contain "name" in Notepad++

Here's how to remove lines that do not contain the string `"name"` in Notepad++ using regular expressions:

1. Open your file in **Notepad++**
2. Press `Ctrl + F` to open the **Find and Replace** dialog box.
3. Go to the **Mark** tab.
4. Check the box labeled **Bookmark line** and ensure **Regular expression** is selected at the bottom.
5. In the **Find what** field, enter the following regex pattern:

   ^(?!.*"name").*$

   This regex looks for lines that do not contain the string `"name"`.

6. Keep the **Replace with** field blank and press **Replace All** 


This will delete all lines that do not contain `"name"`, leaving only the lines that do.
