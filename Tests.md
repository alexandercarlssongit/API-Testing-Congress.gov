1. According to Wikipedia "Congress has 535 voting members: 100 senators and 435 representatives."

2. There are 550 names on the API list. 

These people are not members anymore but are still in the API data:

Dianne Feinstein - She passed away in September 2023.
Ben Sasse - He resigned from the Senate in January 2023 to become the president of the University of Florida.
