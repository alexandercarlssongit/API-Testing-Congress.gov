1. According to Wikipedia "Congress has 535 voting members: 100 senators and 435 representatives."

2. There are 550 names on the API list. 

These people are not members anymore but are still in the API data:

- George Santos - He was expelled from the House of Representatives in December 2023.
- Dianne Feinstein - She passed away in September 2023.
- Ben Sasse - He resigned from the Senate in January 2023 to become the president of the University of Florida.
- Kevin McCarthy - He resigned from Congress in December 2023.
- Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), who resigned after expressing frustrations with Congress
- Reps. Chris Stewart (R-UT) 
- Bill Johnson (R-OH)
- Mike Gallagher (R-WI)


4. There are currently only 99 senators (according to https://www.senate.gov/senators/)

5. According to the official house website there are 440 reps out of which there are **4 vacancies** (https://www.house.gov/representatives).

6. This adds up to 539 people or 535 with the vacancies. 

Conclusion:
The API data has too many names, including names of people who have passed away (Dianne Feinstein) and who have been expelled (George Santos) and people who have resigned.
